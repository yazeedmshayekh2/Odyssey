# Contributing to Car Verification System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Car Verification System as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button in the top-right corner of the GitHub page.

2. **Clone Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OdysseyModelTraining.git
   cd OdysseyModelTraining
   ```

3. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Set Up Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If exists
   ```

5. **Make Your Changes**: 
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation as needed

6. **Test Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   python -m pytest
   
   # Test the API
   python test_api.py
   
   # Test the web interface
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

8. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

9. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and click 'New Pull Request'.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Example:
```python
def extract_car_features(image_path: str, model: torch.nn.Module) -> Optional[np.ndarray]:
    """
    Extract features from a car image using the specified model.
    
    Args:
        image_path: Path to the car image
        model: PyTorch model for feature extraction
        
    Returns:
        Feature vector as numpy array, or None if extraction fails
    """
    try:
        # Implementation here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Feature extraction failed: {e}")
        return None
```

### Code Formatting
We use automated tools to maintain code consistency:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Type checking with mypy
mypy --ignore-missing-imports .

# Linting with flake8
flake8 .
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from car_verification import CarImageVerifier

class TestCarImageVerifier:
    def test_extract_features_success(self):
        """Test successful feature extraction"""
        verifier = CarImageVerifier()
        result = verifier.extract_features("test_image.jpg")
        assert result is not None
        assert result.shape == (2048,)
    
    def test_extract_features_invalid_image(self):
        """Test feature extraction with invalid image"""
        verifier = CarImageVerifier()
        result = verifier.extract_features("nonexistent.jpg")
        assert result is None
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_verification.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Run tests in verbose mode
python -m pytest -v
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation
- Use clear, descriptive docstrings
- Include parameter types and return types
- Provide usage examples
- Document any exceptions that might be raised

### README Updates
When adding new features:
- Update installation instructions if needed
- Add usage examples
- Update the feature list
- Include any new configuration options

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports
Create an issue with the following information:
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, dependencies
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the bug
- **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen
- **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened
- **Error Messages**: Include full error messages and stack traces
- **Screenshots**: If applicable

### Feature Requests
- **Use Case**: Explain why this feature would be useful
- **Description**: Detailed description of the proposed feature
- **Implementation Ideas**: If you have thoughts on how to implement it
- **Alternatives**: Any alternative solutions you've considered

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for testing containerization)

### Optional Tools
- VS Code with Python extension
- PyCharm
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## AI Model Contributions

### Adding New Models
If you want to add support for new AI models:

1. **Create a new model class** inheriting from base model interface
2. **Implement required methods**: `extract_features()`, `preprocess_image()`
3. **Add model tests** with sample images
4. **Update documentation** with model capabilities and requirements
5. **Add model weights** to `.gitignore` and provide download instructions

### Model Performance
When contributing model improvements:
- Include performance benchmarks
- Test with diverse image datasets
- Document accuracy improvements
- Consider computational requirements

## Database Changes

### Schema Migrations
When modifying database schema:
1. Create migration script in `migrations/` directory
2. Test with sample data
3. Provide rollback instructions
4. Update database documentation

### Example Migration
```python
# migrations/add_new_field.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, String
from database import Base, engine

def upgrade():
    # Add new column
    pass

def downgrade():
    # Remove column
    pass
```

## Security Considerations

### Reporting Security Issues
- **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security concerns privately to maintainers
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file uploads
- Use secure defaults
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Questions?

Feel free to contact the maintainers if you have any questions:
- Open an issue for general questions

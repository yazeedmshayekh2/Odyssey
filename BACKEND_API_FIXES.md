# Backend API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Mixed Architecture Pattern**
**Problem:** The main `app.py` file was mixing Flask factory pattern with direct route definitions, causing conflicts and poor separation of concerns.

**Fix:** 
- Cleaned up `app.py` to only handle damage detection API and create the app using the factory
- Moved all other route handling to proper blueprints
- Separated concerns between core app logic and API endpoints

### 2. **CORS Configuration Conflicts**
**Problem:** CORS was configured multiple times in different files with conflicting settings.

**Fix:**
- Centralized CORS configuration in `src/app_factory.py`
- Set proper origins for development (`localhost:3000`, `localhost:5000`)
- Configured proper headers and methods for API endpoints

### 3. **JWT Secret Key Security Issues**
**Problem:** JWT secret keys were hardcoded in multiple files with different values.

**Fix:**
- Centralized JWT configuration to use Flask app config
- Created `get_jwt_secret()` function to retrieve from app config
- Set up environment variable support for secure key management

### 4. **Blueprint Registration Issues**
**Problem:** Some blueprints were using registration functions while others were direct imports, causing inconsistency.

**Fix:**
- Standardized all blueprint registration in `src/app_factory.py`
- Removed duplicate registration functions
- Cleaned up import statements across all modules

### 5. **Database Configuration Duplication**
**Problem:** Database configuration was duplicated across multiple files.

**Fix:**
- Centralized database configuration in `src/config/db.py`
- All modules now import from the centralized config
- Environment variables properly loaded for database settings

### 6. **Authentication Code Duplication**
**Problem:** There were duplicate authentication files (`user_auth.py` and `routes.py`) causing conflicts.

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate `user_auth.py` file
- Kept organized structure with `routes.py` (for web templates) and `api_routes.py` (for REST API)
- Centralized authentication utilities in `utils.py`

### 7. **Inconsistent API Response Formats**
**Problem:** API endpoints had inconsistent response formats and error handling.

**Fix:**
- Standardized all API responses to use consistent JSON format
- Improved error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Added proper authentication middleware for protected endpoints

## API Endpoints Summary

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `POST /api/auth/upload-documents` - Upload user documents

### Car Management Endpoints
- `GET /api/cars/parts` - Get list of car parts for insurance
- `GET /api/cars/` - Get user's cars
- `GET /api/cars/<car_id>` - Get specific car details
- `POST /api/cars/` - Register new car
- `PUT /api/cars/<car_id>` - Update car details
- `DELETE /api/cars/<car_id>` - Delete car

### Damage Detection Endpoint
- `POST /api/detect-damage` - Upload image for damage analysis

### Utility Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
DB_NAME=car_insurance

# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True
PORT=5000

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here

# Upload Configuration
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=16777216
```

## Testing

A test script `test_api.py` has been created to verify all API endpoints are working correctly. Run it with:

```bash
python test_api.py
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: Proper JWT handling with environment-based secrets
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and standardized structure
3. **Scalability**: Modular blueprint architecture allows easy addition of new features
4. **Reliability**: Consistent error handling and response formats
5. **Development**: Better CORS configuration for frontend integration

## Next Steps

1. Set up proper environment variables in production
2. Add API rate limiting and additional security measures
3. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
5. Set up automated testing pipeline
